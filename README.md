# Spatial transcriptomics data analysis using R 

**Author:** Phillip Nicol

## Overview 

This repository contains materials for a workshop on spatial transcriptomics data analysis at the University of Puerto Rico. Broadly, it covers the following topics 

1.	Review of spatial transcriptomics technologies.
2.	Spatial transcriptomics data structure and storage in R.
3.	Finding spatially variable genes.
4.	Dimension reduction, clustering, and identification of marker genes.

The topics are motivated by an in-depth analysis of a real spatial transcriptomics dataset from the human brain.
